## What should i do ? 
This game is still under development as i said. But once it finish you'll be able to play it freely. 
I'm working on versions the first shot is gonna played on the terminal after cloning the repo and launching the .py file. The next is gonna be developed with GUI
SO the player could function well and focus more in the game. 


## Things to be done : 
* Exec an intro & logo 
* Code aside GUI
* Work on the story 
* Import the needed libraries
