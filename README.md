You have some goals to achieve. But you have to be ready first. You're not a warrior, You are a leader, a master 
You need to learn and practise and be familiar with all of the sciences (Mathematics, Geometry, History, Geography and more..) 
Because the worlds fate is on you now. You're gonna lead an army to fight for what's right. And to spread knowledge and fight ignorance..

This game is divided on levels, each level should determine if you can pass to the next one or not. 
Each level will have a Quiz with a guidline to follow. Each question you answer will enable you to increase your points and move on to the next.

## :memo: What should i do ? 
This game is still under development as i said. But once it finish you'll be able to play it freely. 
I'm working on versions the first shot is gonna played on the terminal after cloning the repo and launching the .py file. The next is gonna be developed with GUI
SO the player could function well and focus more in the game.

## :dart: Things to be done : 
* Git secret or encrypyted files 
* Coupons (I need to think more about that) 
* Make good puzzles man
